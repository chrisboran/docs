# Lab Report for a POC

## Context

As software engineers we apply discipline to the creation of software. This rigor is our responsibiltiy 
to ensure we are making wise decsions for our business and for our customers. Often when a person 
does a Proof of Concept (POC) they do it in a very unstructured way, and sometimes it becomes very unclear 
as to what the actual outcome of the POC was. 

To apply discipline to this process, we like to ask teams to do old fashioned science -- write a lab 
report to help focus your POC and clarify both why you are doing it and what the success crtiera are.

Hereafter we will refer to the POC as the 'experiment'. 

# POC Lab Report Template

## Introduction

Includes the reason the experiment is being performed, relevant background information about the 
concept being examined, and the hypothesis or questions being asked in the experiment.

## Materials and Methods

States what you did with enough detail to allow the reader to repeat the experiment. Write this 
section with the audience in mind; most people donot need to blown away with details, but they 
should understand your options and evaluation criteria up front.

## Results

Presents the results in text and optionally graphic form (figures, tables, graphs) and describes the general
trends seen in the data. Do not offer any explanation for the results in this section, just stick to the results
being compared to your criteria.

## Discussion

Tries to answer the question "Why?" Explains what was expected and what was found. Does
the data support the original hypothesis? Why or why not? This section presents reasons for the
results obtained in the experiment and references related studies. It also includes potential
sources of error. The discussion is the meat of the paper. Do not use the word "probably."

## Conclusion

Consists of a single paragraph stating the outcome expressed in terms of the original hypothesis. 
Restate the objective, the results, and important discussion findings. Does NOT introduce new material.
